Hi, Iâ€™m @gitjayson.

I am packing Decades of systems and storage design workflow and implementation experience deploying change rapidly and often, one exception at a time.

Currently working on migrating a data backup and archiving workflow process with 1000+ bare metal databases into RDS while the plane is in the air.
